# NHL Player Analysis With Python

Over time the sports world has begun creating more and more stats in order to track players' involvement in their respective games. Some fans and commentators of hockey feel that these new "advanced" analytics are unnecessary and not worth taking into account. I want to see which tracked statistics could be best used to predict the amount of points a player will accumulate.

Using  Python, I analyzed NHL player stats to test my hypothesis that traditional player stats were a better predictor for point production instead of new-age advanced stats
